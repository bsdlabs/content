	-Happy #Marchintosh2022, everyone! This month, we'll be examining the early
	connections between UNIX, BSD, and Apple's classic/current operating
	systems! This could be a whole weekly segment on its own, so these threads 
	will be a tweet or two longer. :) >>

	-To start, we'll need to backtrack to around 1985, when this guy named Steve
	Jobs was forced out of Apple by someone he hired, which is a whole other
	story for another time. Jobs quickly created NeXT, a software and
	hardware company that would change the world. >>

	-NeXT promptly started working on their operating system, called NeXTSTEP,
	and it was groundbreaking in several ways! It incorporated: a Unix-like OS,
	based on Mach and 4.3BSD-Tahoe and Display PostScript. It was used to
	develop the WWW, Doom, and Doom II! >>

	-It also premiered some very interesting UI features; namely the iconic Dock
	from macOS, the Shelf, a kind of recently-used item storage, full-color
	icons, and its hybrid kernel that macOS still uses, owed to its Mach/BSD
	heritage. :) >>

	-Okily-dokily neighborino- that does it for this first week! We'll see you
	next time for our #Marchintosh2022-themed BSD History!

	-We're continuing our #Marchintosh2022 themed segment content! This week
	we're diving into NeXTSTEP's hybrid kernel, which still exists in macOS to
	this day in XNU, the kernel of Darwin, which is the base for macOS. NeXTSTEP
	was, and is, integral to Apple. >>
	
	-Throughout most of its life, NeXTSTEP used 4.3BSD-Tahoe, changing to 4.3BSD-Reno
	for its 3.0 release, and during Rhapsody development, upgraded to 4.4BSD.
	We'll focus on Mach first: developed at Carnegie Mellon by Richard Rashid
	and Avie Tevanian. >>

	-Originally, Mach was developed to support operating system research-
	parallel and distributed computing, specifically. Thanks to these two
	concepts, it became an early example of a microkernel! Microkernels
	are rad, just ask our cousin @DragonFlyBSD. ;) >>

	-Mach was also intended to be drop-in replacement for BSD's kernel, so Mach
	and BSD were close from the start. In fact, in 4.4BSD, Mach's virtual memory
	management system was adopted by the developers at the previously mentioned
	CSRG; it even appears in modern BSDs today! >>

	-Development for Mach started with 4.2BSD, changing to 4.3BSD as Mach became
	more integrated into the system. By 1986, it could run on a DEC VAX,
	followed by an IBM RT PC- a PC based on RISC tech, and then the 68030-based
	Sun Microsystem workstations. >>

	-That'll wrap us for this week, NeXT week we'll be focusing on NeXT as a
	company, and the software and hardware they developed! Take it easy,
	beasties! :)
