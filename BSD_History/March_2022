	-Happy #Marchintosh2022, everyone! This month, we'll be examining the early
	connections between UNIX, BSD, and Apple's classic/current operating
	systems! This could be a whole weekly segment on its own, so these threads 
	will be a tweet or two longer. :) >>

	-To start, we'll need to backtrack to around 1985, when this guy named Steve
	Jobs was forced out of Apple by someone he hired, which is a whole other
	story for another time. Jobs quickly created NeXT, a software and
	hardware company that would change the world. >>

	-NeXT promptly started working on their operating system, called NeXTSTEP,
	and it was groundbreaking in several ways! It incorporated: a Unix-like OS,
	based on Mach and 4.3BSD-Tahoe and Display PostScript. It was used to
	develop the WWW, Doom, and Doom II! >>

	-It also premiered some very interesting UI features; namely the iconic Dock
	from macOS, the Shelf, a kind of recently-used item storage, full-color
	icons, and its hybrid kernel that macOS still uses, owed to its Mach/BSD
	heritage. :) >>

	-Okily-dokily neighborino- that does it for this first week! We'll see you
	next Friday for our #Marchintosh2022-themed BSD History!
