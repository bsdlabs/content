	-Happy February! When we left off last week, we were about to jump into the
	BSD specific history. UNIX first arrived at Berkeley around 1974, requested
	by Bob Fabry- who founded the Computer Systems Research Group. >>

	-Initially run on a PDP-11/45 that was shared by a math/statistics group at
	Berkeley, so it could only run around 8 hours at a time. Later on, using
	money from the Ingres database project, they grabbed a PDP-11/70. >>

	-That same year, Ken Thompson dropped by and helped install Version 6 Unix,
	and started working on a Pascal implementation as well. A couple graduate
	students, Charles Haley and Bill Joy, ran with this base and created 'ex',
	an editor, now part of 'vi' and 'vim'! >>

	-That wraps it for today! We'll see you next week, on Friday! :)

	-Howdy! Let's jump back into BSD land. :) Ken Thompson had just dropped by
	and helped with Version 6, and Joy and Haley had created 'ex'. As 1977 came
	closer, more and more interest was piqued, so Bill started compiling in
	1977, and then released as 1BSD in 1978. >>

	-Interestingly enough, 1BSD was an addon to Version 6 Unix! Only around 30 copies
	were released- but you can find it now at
	https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=1BSD! Soon after, in 1979, 2BSD
	was out, and with it the C Shell and the 'vi' editor, both by Bill Joy! >>

	-2BSD had about 75 copies released, and you can check out the files at the
	link in the previous tweet! This version came with Berknet, part of Eric
	Schmidt's master's thesis. Berknet allowed up to 26 computers to connect
	with file sharing and email. >>

	-All right! Catch you next week, same time, same place!

	-Hey all you beasties! Did you know 2BSD is still being updated? 2.11BSD received
	its 473rd patch this past January 25! Berkeley got a VAX machine around
	1978, but since UNIX/32V didn't support its virtual memory
	capabilities, Ozalp Babaoglu stepped up. >>

	-Babaoglu rewrote the 32V's kernel to include this, and along with 2BSD
	and 32V utilities working on the VAX, was released as 3BSD at the end of
	1979! 3BSD was also called Virtual VAX/UNIX or VMUNIX. In fact, up until
	4.4BSD, kernel images were called /vmunix. >>

	-VMUNIX had great success, thanks to CSRG funding from DARPA. This would
	mean a standard UNIX platform for DARPA research for the VLSI Project. VLSI
	was a program to improve microprocessors- and influenced things like CAD and
	RISC. >>

	-Thanks for your time today! Hope your weekend goes well, and #RUNBSD where
	you can, and maybe where you can't! ;)

	-Good afternoon in CST! Hope you're all doing well- BSD sure is. B) In 1980,
	4BSD was released. This release came with 'delivermail', a precursor to
	'sendmail', 'csh', and, surprisingly, the Curses language. I had no idea it
	went back that far! >> 

	-It was followed soon by 4.1BSD in the summer of 1981. This release would
	have been called '5BSD', but AT&T was concerned about confusion between it
	and UNIX System V. Bill joy included many kernel and system-level
	improvements and tune-ups in this release. >>
	
	-4BSD was preferred for VAX machines, until System III was released. Many
	systems inside the Bell System (the group of companies led by Bell) ran
	4.1BSD, or 4.2BSD. Joy's work made 4.1BSD performant enough to compete with
	VMS (now OpenVMS), DEC's OS for VAX. >>

	-Okay, that wraps us up for February! See y'all in March! :)
