	-And we're back after a week break! Hope April's been kind to everyone. :)
	4.2BSD was on the horizon, and everyone was hard at work on the interim
	releases 4.1a, 4.1b, and 4.1c. 4.1a brought BBN's (more commonly known as
	Raytheon) TCP/IP in a modified form. >>

	-Most of this work was done by Bill Joy, who worked on tuning the 4.1BSD
	release previously. According to John Gage, Bill Joy created his own TCP/IP
	stack that performed better than the Raytheon/BBN version, and when asked
	how he did it, responded with: >>

	-"It's very simple- you read the protocol and write the code." Raytheon's
	Rob Gurwitz, of course, disputes this. Either way, the TCP/IP stack, heavily
	restructured and created by Joy, remains one of the pinnacles of network
	programming today. >>

	-Along with this came some temporary utilities for remote management and
	access, like 'rwho', 'rcp', 'rlogin', and 'rsh'. They were prototypes, 
	and intended to be replaced later by more "reasonable" implementations,
	thus the 'r' prefix. >>

	-4.1b brought the Berkeley Fast File System, a predecessor to the UFS that
	most BSDs still use and support. This was brought in thanks to the efforts
	of Marshall Kirk McKusick, who is incredibly integral to FreeBSD, and still
	works on FFS/UFS, 40 years later! >>

	-4.1b, in McKusick's words, came from the integration of the Berkeley Fast
	File System with the 4.1a kernel. This release was heavily developmental,
	and only ran on a few machines. They didn't want to release so many big
	changes to the main line just yet. >>

	-As an aside, it was at this time that Joy joined Sun Microsystems, and
	started to split his time between Sun and BSD. While working for Sun, his
	time at BSD was spent polishing his code and refining the Unix kernel
	sources to isolate machine dependencies. >>

	-4.1c was essentially a Release Candidate for 4.2BSD. Bell Labs also
	used it for the 8th Edition of Research Unix, and mt Xinu (say it backwards
	;) ) put out a commercially supported version for the DEC VAX. >>

	-Since 4.1c included the new filesystem and other features, many vendors
	used it to prepare for ports of 4.2BSD on their hardware. With distribution
	starting in 1983, Pauline Schwartz was hired to take over that process. >>

	-Well, that about wraps things up for this week! We hope you liked the
	extended length- we really enjoyed writing it! :) Stay Unix, my friends!

	-Alrighty! A little late, but still here: BSD History! So, in August 1983,
	4.2 was released! It was very successful- more than 1,000 site licenses were
	released, which is more than all of the previous Berkeley releases
	combined!>>
	
	-Compared to System V UNIX, 4.2BSD had McKusick's Fast File System and 
	networking from BBN (now Raytheon), so vendors usually shipped it instead.
	System V eventually integrated those innovations and reclaimed its dominant
	commercial place, but 4.2BSD was incredibly noteworthy.
	
	-Some very neat resources for this release that are too long to summarize, 
	even for these extended formats, are: 

	4.2BSD Source Code- [https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.2BSD]
	
	4.2BSD File Usage Analysis-
	[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/323627.323631] >>

	-4.2BSD Performance Comparison to 4.1BSD-
	[https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA611681.pdf] >>

	-4.2BSD had many functional and technical advances over its predecessor, but
	there were valid criticisms- namely, its performance was not up to 4.1BSD.
	Kirk McKusick and Mike Karels' first year working on it was spent tuning it
	up and making it performant. >>

	-After two years, as 4.3BSD came 'round the corner and its release
	announcement at the 1985 June USENIX Conference was made, BBN pumped the
	brakes. They complained that their final version of the TCP/IP stack had
	never been included in 4.2BSD. >>

	-Karels did an evaluation of Berkeley's and BBN's implementations, and
	decided, ultimately, that both should be kept, with the good bits from the
	BBN version merged into the Berkeley version, and the user could decide
	which one to use in their kernel. >>

	-DARPA, seeing Karels' decision, figured that maintaining two versions would
	be too much, and both versions were given to an agreed-upon neutral third
	party, Mike Muuss of the Ballistics Research Laboratory. Quite a bit of
	testing later, Berkeley came out on top! >>

	-Berkeley's version handled stress conditions better, so it was kept, and
	DARPA solidified its place in 4.2BSD and onward. This, along with all the
	polishing and tuning done by McKusick and Karels, set the team up for the
	4.3BSD release! >>

	-That is, unfortunately, all the time we have for this week, but! Did you
	know 4.2BSD introduced the BSD Beastie (created by John Lasseter!)? It's so cute! :) Have a great
	weekend and week, everyone! 

2022.04.22
	-Good afternoon from CST, all! 4.3BSD, after the networking debacle between
	Berkeley and BBN (Raytheon), was finally out in June of 1986. Even though
	lots of vendors had already started moving back to System V, the advances in
	4.3BSD were merged back into their systems. >>

	-After 4.3BSD's release, a company called Computer Consoles Inc. was working 
	on a VAX competitor, the Power 6/32. They wanted to have 4.3BSD running on 
	their machine, so they sent some Power 6/32s over to the BSD team. >>

	-Even though its architecture and design were halted soon after, porting 
	4.3BSD to it let the team finish up a project started by Bill Joy: 
	splitting the BSD kernel into machine-dependent and machine-independent
	parts. >>

	-This work was released as 4.3SBD-Tahoe, referencing the codename for the
	short-lived Power 6/32 machine that had fueled the significant increase in
	portability. Tahoe also added an implementation of the OSI network protocol
	stack and >>

	-new TCP/IP algorithms, with Van Jacobson of LBL, to help with the growth of
	the internet. If you're interested in reading the full changelog, it's right
	here! [https://gunkies.org/wiki/4.3_BSD_Tahoe] >>

	-Now, if you checked that source, you'll notice a name we haven't touched on
	yet- Keith Bostic. Bostic joined the CSRG at Berkeley in 1986, and requested
	that he be able to finish the project started at his other job: porting the
	freshly released 4.3BSD to the PDP-11. >>

	-As skeptical as Mike Karels and Kirk McKusick were, they agreed to let him
	attempt it. Bostic, to their surprise, completed it- compiling the 4.3BSD
	kernel down to ~250KB and using the intricacies of the PDP-11's processor
	and overlay states to get the job done. >>

	-Bostic's work was integrated the previously mentioned 2.11BSD, which was
	released in 1991 as the 20 year celebration for the PDP-11! The original
	release announcement is here:
	[https://www.krsaborio.net/bsd/research/1991/0314.htm]. >>

	-So, up until now, all recipients of BSD needed an AT&T source license. This
	was because all BSD versions had been bundled with their source- their
	success and legacy attesting to the flexibility and communal growth that
	comes from having your source available. >>

	-Vendors using BSD primarily for its networking tools had found the licensing 
	cost increasingly prohibitive as AT&T raised their license prices, so they 
	started requesting that Berkeley package and release the TCP/IP code and
	networking utilities separately- so they did. >>

	-Named Networking Release 1 or Net/1, and released in June 1989, this
	freely-redistributable software paved the way for the BSD License and the
	distribution methods of BSDs to come. <3 >>

	-That'll do it for this week, folks- we'll be taking a break next week, so
	we'll see you the first week of May! #RunBSD, because it's fantastic!
