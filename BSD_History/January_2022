	-Welcome to 2022! Glad you're all still here with us. :) Let's get back to it.
	As UNIX's userbase grew, so did the hardware it ran on. It was increasingly
	written in the C programming language, and soon, around 1977, Bell Labs gave
	the team an Interdata 8/32. >>

	-The goal here was to diversify the types of systems that UNIX could run on,
	so UNIX was ported to the 8/32, and soon after it was running as a guest
	system on a hypervisor VM/370 at Princeton. The VM/370 was a mainframe 
	introduced 7 years earlier. >>

	-And, interestingly enough, the family of virtual machines the VM/370
	belonged to, called VM, was open source and considered public domain until
	around the time UNIX was ported to it! This versatility has become a
	hallmark of the UNIX and UNIX-like systems. >>

	-We'll end it here, but we'll be thinking about next Friday when we can
	share more about this fascinating family of systems we all love. <3 As
	January gets under way, we hope you stay safe and #RunBSD. :)

	-Hey all! Kicking off this Friday with #BSDHistory, as usual! UNIX was
	expanding, having multiple systems under its belt and large parts of its
	codebase written in C. An Intel 8086 based computer with a custom MMU and
	the UNIVAC 1100 were quickly added. >>

	-Next up was UNIX/32V for DEC's new VAX system- DEC had to request this
	version from a different Bell Labs branch, as the group working on the
	original UNIX didn't really like DEC by that time. And then, in 1979,
	Version 7 was released. >> 

	-With Version 7's release, the little OS that could had grown into a
	burgeoning contender for a universal OS, with about 50 system calls and,
	counting the versions for specific uses (like PWB, the Programmer's
	Workbench), at least 800 systems in use. >>

	-Leaving on a high note! As usual, we'll see you next Friday. :)

	-#BSDHistory time, everyone! Into the 80s, UNIX was expanding and gaining
	corporate support. In 1981, UNIX System III was released, and you could grab
	a license for US$100 (US$293 in 2022). To some, this marked the
	commercialization of UNIX by Bell. >>

	-Not all was well in Bell land, however. After UNIX System V Release 1 was
	created, the US Department of Justice settled an antitrust law against AT&T
	in 1983, their second one. AT&T broke into smaller companies, known as "Baby
	Bells." >>

	-While this was a good thing, it was bad for UNIX. One of the smaller
	companies AT&T created was called AT&T Computer Systems- and this one didn't
	have any of the restrictions that prevented the old company from
	commercializing UNIX fully. >>

	-Leaving on a low note, this time. Keep your head up, though, as there are
	good things coming. :) #RunBSD! 


2022.28.21
	-Hi hi! Hoping this month was good for you, and your final weekend of
	January 2022 is relaxing and restful. :) Okay, where were we? AT&T Computer
	Systems had just been created, giving a green light for full
	commercialization of UNIX. >>

	-They quickly released UNIX System V, which competed against the prior
	releases of UNIX. The researchers at Berkeley (yes, that Berkeley!) of 
	'vi' and 'curses' fame, continued their work on UNIX as BSD, like they had
	been for System V Release 1. >>

	-BSD 4.1-4.3 added quite a bit to commercial UNIX, most notably the C Shell
	with job control, and its networking TCP/IP stack, which was even included
	in early versions of Microsoft Windows and System V. Next week, we'll take a
	dive into BSD-specific history. 

	-Appreciate yall's time, as always! Stay safe physically and digitally (by
	running BSD ;) ) going into the new month! :)
