Ideas for weekly upates- 
-Little BSD factoids weekly. Can be threads, but preferably one topic and max of 2/3 tweets a thread.
-Can be planned out in advanced so there's a possibility of themed weeks/months
-Possibly automated as well? # look into this.

	-BSD History:		Fridays
		Little pieces of info about the development, creation, and ideation of BSD UNIX.

	-BSD DYK:	  		Mondays
		Pick a BSD OS and share a cool fact about it.

		Share an Open Source project that you appreciate, and some info on it, and how to get it.
